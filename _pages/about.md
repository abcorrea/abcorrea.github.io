**Hi!**

I am a **Junior Research Fellow** at Christ Church, University of Oxford. My
research focuses on **safe and trustworthy AI**. More specifically, I study
**how to ensure that AI systems that plan and act in the world do so reliably and
correctly**. I work on automated planning, LLM-assisted reasoning, and the formal
foundations of AI.

Before coming to Oxford, I obtained my Ph.D. (and also my Master's degree) at
the University of Basel, Switzerland, under the supervision of Prof. Malte
Helmert. Even before that, I completed my Bachelor's degree in the Federal
University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, under the supervision of Prof. André
G. Pereira and Prof. Marcus Ritt.
