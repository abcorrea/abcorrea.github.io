**Hi!**

I am a Junior Research Fellow at Christ Church college, University of Oxford,
United Kingdom. My research is on **automated planning**, with a particular
focus on **how to plan over different representations**. Most of my previous
work was on **lifted planning** and **grounding**. But I also worked on other
things, such as interactive proofs for planning and some computational
complexity questions.

Before coming to Oxford, I obtained my Ph.D. (and also my Master's degree) at
the University of Basel, Switzerland, under the supervision of Prof. Malte
Helmert. Even before that, I completed my Bachelor's degree in the Federal
University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, under the supervision of Prof. Andr√©
G. Pereira and Prof. Marcus Ritt.
